Subject: Question: Access to Public Avatars via API

Hi HeyGen Support,

We're building an application that uses the HeyGen API and would like to know if it's possible to access and use public/shared avatars that are available in the HeyGen platform via the API.

**Questions:**
1. Is there an API endpoint to list public avatars available to all users?
2. Can we use public avatar IDs in video generation requests (both template-based and direct avatar video generation)?
3. Are there any restrictions or special requirements for using public avatars via the API?

We've tried several endpoint variations but haven't found a specific endpoint for public avatars. Any guidance would be appreciated.

Thanks,
